# Phase 3: Defensive Strategy Proposal: Using Fail2Ban to Secure SSH

## Objective

Secure the SSH service on the victim machine (**Metasploitable3**) by using **Fail2Ban** to detect and block brute-force SSH attacks.

---

## Vulnerability Overview

- **Service Targeted**: SSH (Port 22)  
- **Issue**: SSH was accessible using **password authentication**, making it vulnerable to brute-force attacks.
- **Initial Security Posture**: No control in place to block repeated failed login attempts.

> Result: SSH allows both `publickey` and `password` authentication.

---

### Configure SSH Jail Settings
```bash
sudo nano /etc/fail2ban/jail.local
```
Edit the `[sshd]` section to enable jail and define settings:

- `enabled = true`
- `port = ssh`
- `filter = sshd`
- `logpath = /var/log/auth.log`
- `maxretry = 6`
- `findtime = 600`
- `bantime = 600`

### Restart and Verify Fail2Ban
```bash
sudo service fail2ban restart
sudo fail2ban-client status
sudo fail2ban-client status sshd
```

## Testing the Defense

### Re-launch the Brute-Force Attack

Used the same brute-force script from Phase 1.  
After exceeding `maxretry`, **Fail2Ban** detected the attack and **banned the attacker's IP**.

### SSH Access Denied

SSH became inaccessible from the banned attacker's IP, confirming the defense worked as intended.

## Results Summary

| Phase                  | Description                                | Status      |
|------------------------|--------------------------------------------|-------------|
| Vulnerability Identified | SSH with password login exposed          |  Detected |
| Fail2Ban Installed     | Deployed on Metasploitable3                | Completed |
| Jail Configured & Active | Monitoring auth.log for failures        | Completed |
| Attack Simulated Again | IP exceeded retry threshold                | Triggered |
| IP Successfully Banned | SSH access refused from attacker's IP     | Verified  |

---

## Conclusion

By deploying **Fail2Ban**, we successfully protected the SSH service on **Metasploitable3** from brute-force attacks.  
This **reactive control** monitored login attempts and automatically banned malicious IPs, blocking further intrusion attempts.

> ✅ After exceeding the allowed login failures, the attacker’s IP was blocked, fully mitigating the threat.
