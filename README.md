## Overview
This project focuses on simulating a real-world cybersecurity scenario through three main phases: attacking, analyzing, and defending a vulnerable system. In Phase 1, we set up a vulnerable virtual machine (Metasploitable3) and successfully compromised a selected service using Metasploit and a custom script. In Phase 2, we analyzed the attack using a SIEM tool (Splunk) by integrating logs from victim environment to visualize and understand the attack patterns. Finally, in Phase 3, we proposed and implemented a defense mechanism to protect the targeted service, demonstrating its effectiveness by comparing the system's security before and after the defense was applied.


This project was developed solely for educational purposes as part of the ICS344 course at KFUPM
